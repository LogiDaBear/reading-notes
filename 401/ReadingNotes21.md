# Django REST Framework & Docker

## What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?

- Image: An image is a blueprint for a container. It contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Images are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created.
- Container: A container is a running instance of an image. It is a lightweight, isolated environment that runs the application code and its dependencies. Containers share the host operating system kernel, which makes them efficient and portable.
- Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It is a simple way to automate the process of creating images.
- Docker Engine: The Docker Engine is the software that runs Docker containers. It manages images, containers, and networks.
