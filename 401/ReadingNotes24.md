### Key principles for organizing and configuring Django settings
- Keep settings DRY (don't repeat yourself).
- Use environment variables to store sensitive settings.
- Use a settings file for development and another for production.
- Use a configuration management tool to manage settings across environments.
### How White Noise helps with serving static files
- White Noise is a caching middleware that helps to serve static files more efficiently.
- It does this by caching static files in memory or on disk, and by serving them from a single location.
- To integrate White Noise into a Django project, you need to install the whitenoise package and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.
- You also need to add the whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware middleware to your MIDDLEWARE setting.
### What is CORS and how to implement it in Django
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web applications to make requests to resources from other origins.
- This is useful for things like AJAX requests and embedding content from other websites.
- To implement CORS in Django, you need to install the django-cors-headers package.
- Once you have installed the package, you need to add it to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.
- You also need to add the corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware middleware to your MIDDLEWARE setting.
- Finally, you need to configure the CORS settings in your settings.py file.
