## Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

Django models are a fundamental component of Django, a popular web framework in Python. They serve as a high-level abstraction layer that allows developers to define the structure and behavior of their application's data models, which are then used to create and manage the database schema.

## Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?


The Django Admin interface is a powerful built-in feature that comes with Django. It is an automatic administrative interface that allows developers and administrators to manage the application's data and perform various CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) without writing any custom views or templates. The Django Admin is designed to be highly customizable and can be easily tailored to suit the specific needs of a project.

## Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

Components of a Django Application:

- Models: Define the data structure and manage the database.
- Views: Handle user requests, process data, and return responses.
- Templates: Render dynamic HTML pages for presentation.
- Workflow of a Django Application:

- User sends a request to a specific URL.
- URL Dispatcher maps the URL to the corresponding view function.
- View processes the request, interacts with models, and prepares data.
- Template renders the data to generate an HTML page.
- HTTP Response returns the HTML page to the user's web browser.
- User interacts with the page, triggering new requests.
- Interactions between Components:

- Models manage data and interact with the database.
- Views handle user requests and process data from models.
- Templates receive data from views and render dynamic content.
- URL Dispatcher maps URLs to appropriate view functions.
- Forms facilitate user input and data validation.
