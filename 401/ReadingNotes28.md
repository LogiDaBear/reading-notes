## What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

- React Context is a feature in React that provides a way to share data between components without the need to pass props manually through each level of the component tree. It allows you to create a centralized store of data that can be accessed by any component in the application, making state management and data sharing more efficient and convenient.

## Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

- The useContext Hook is a feature introduced in React to access data from a React Context within a functional component without the need for a Context.Consumer component. It simplifies the process of consuming shared data by providing a direct and convenient way to access the data.

- To use the useContext Hook, you first need to create a React Context using React.createContext(). Then, in the component tree, you wrap the part of the application where you want the data to be available with a Context.Provider component, passing the shared data as the value prop.

## Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

 
- Next.js is a popular open-source framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) React applications. It is built on top of React and provides additional features that simplify and enhance the development process. Next.js aims to make it easier to create scalable and production-ready web applications, offering features like server-side rendering, static site generation, automatic code splitting, and more.
