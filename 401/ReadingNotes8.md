# Ten Thousand 4 Notes

## What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.
 -  Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). For example `__init__` or `__str__`.

 
## In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?
  - Using developers work without attribution- Stealing GitHub code. This could have been avoided by Siraj not being a scumbag in more ways than one. His attribution was very minimal and misleading, it should have been forked instead of being cloned.

## Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation.
  - ChatGPT says "The Python statistics module is a built-in module introduced in Python 3.4 that provides a set of functions for performing various statistical operations. It offers a convenient way to calculate statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and more."

  - Here are several examples from the [reading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html):
    `mean()`

    Arithmetic mean (“average”) of data.

    `fmean()`

    Fast, floating point arithmetic mean, with optional weighting.

    `geometric_mean()`

    Geometric mean of data.

    `harmonic_mean()`

    Harmonic mean of data.

    `median()`

    Median (middle value) of data.

    `median_low()`

    Low median of data.

    `median_high()`

    High median of data.

   `median_grouped()`

    Median, or 50th percentile, of grouped data.

    `mode()`

    Single mode (most common value) of discrete or nominal data.

    `multimode()`

    List of modes (most common values) of discrete or nominal data.

    `quantiles()`

    Divide data into intervals with equal probability.
