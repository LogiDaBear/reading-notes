This topic is important because it will help us understand that nothing done for the first time is easy and to alter your thinking in a way that benefits self.

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can? 
    - My ability to persevere through challenges, ingenuity with tools given to me, and my infinite hunger to be know everything about the task at     hand.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
- Take a look at something else for a moment and come back with a clear mind
- Reach out to fellow developers and friends
