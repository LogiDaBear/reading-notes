1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

### (ChatGPT explanation helped me understand these questions - prompted just with the questions as is links were a little murky for me brain)

- Classes:

 A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
 It encapsulates related data and functions into a single unit.
 Classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name.

- Objects:

 An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of the class, created using the class blueprint.
 Each object has its own set of attributes and can have unique values for those attributes.
 Objects are created by calling the class as if it were a function, which is known as instantiation.

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

- Recursion can be a powerful technique for solving problems that exhibit recursive or self-referential structures. However, it's important to ensure the base case, recursive case, and progress towards the base case are properly defined to avoid infinite recursion or incorrect results. 
- Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself during its execution. In other words, a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and then solving those subproblems recursively until a base case is reached.

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

- By leveraging pytest fixtures for test setup and teardown and monitoring code coverage, you can improve the overall quality of your codebase, increase test effectiveness, and make your project more maintainable.
