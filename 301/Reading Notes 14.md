# Diversity & Inclusion

## The time women stopped coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers.

This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies
1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
- Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
- Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. 
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
- When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies
