# REST (something you dont get if youre east coast doing this bootcamp)

### Who is Roy Fielding?
 - A smart guy that helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet
### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
 - Because they were not designed like that first and foremost- 2nd you need a url to be redirected.
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
 - It applies verbs to nouns- the web browser does an http get on the url typed
### What does a GET do?
 - A get is how the url is retrieved
### What does a POST do?
 - A post adds something to another system
### What does PUT do?
 - A put is a partial update
### What does PATCH do?
 - A patch is a full update
