# APIs
What does REST stand for?
Representational State Transfer

REST APIs are designed around resources.


What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.
A URI that uniquely identifies that resource such as object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
ex:
HTTP

Copy
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

What are the most common HTTP verbs?
 GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

What should the URIs be based on?
web API frameworks can route requests based on parameterized URIs.

Give an example of a good URI.
/orders/99/customer. rather than /customers/5/orders

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
The more requests, the bigger the load. Bad thing.


What status code does a successful GET request return?
200

What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
404

What status code does a successful POST request return?
201

What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
204

## Things I want to know more about
Are all '404' numbers based all on the idea of this REST method?
