# The basics and some definitions for Markdown beginners

## When using Markdown there are Headers, like the one above, and even this one, that you can change the sizes of using a number of #'s (one # being the biggest)

When you are using headers DO NOT tab and make sure is all left centered to avoid any errors.

Paragraphs are made by creating a blank line inbetween your next one. Ex: line 5 has text, 6 does not (press enter twice) and line 7 is where this started.

There are a few ways to use bold but for simplicity sake just stick to double stars as to not **break** anything.

For Ordered lists, something confusing but hey! I didn't make markdown is that as long as Markdown starts with 1 the rest of the numbers in the list don't matter as long as they are followed by a period.

In order to mark a word as code you need to enclose it in backticks (') such as 'this'.

I want to learn more about code blocks as I don't think it was explained thoroughly in this guide but I believe I have the jist (gist?) of it.

Creating a linked word you use square brackets [with the word/words in them] (followed by the url). <- That would be a url. You can take this further and you can add a title in following the URL with "Title" then closing with ).

If you want to display characters that otherwise might implode on themselves you want to use a backslash \ before the characters to escape it. Ex: \** look at this non-bold.

Images seem finicky so far as some are drage and drop, others you copy and paste the source. I need to look into and understand the WHY more on this one.
