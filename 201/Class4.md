# Reading Notes for HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

These topics matter because they are the entire scope of this weeks objectives and apply to everything we are currently doing.

## Learn HTML

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

Inside an anchor tag and using the href attribute which contains the web address.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

It holds the actual address for the website that will be the direction you are taken when clicking the anchored word.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

By putting it in regular text rather than in a link tag so that it can be typed out or copy pasted if for instance it works on a Mac but not on a Windows system.

## CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

The way that webpage elements default layout is before altering.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

[Block-level-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements) are that entire...blocks? element being altered as in that entire space from left to right wheras
[Inline-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements) display just that specific area or just specified elements.

3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

A major advantage to [absolute-positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning#absolute_positioning) is having an isolated UI that we can move and drag and drop places without having to interfere with space on our static positioning.

5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

[Fixed-positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning#fixed_positioning) is different from absolute positioning in the sense that they are usually fixed to a position that is always visible even if the page scrolls.

## JS

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

Function declaration is the initial creation of what it will be. Function invocation is calling the already created function to run where you need it to by dropping its declaration you gave it into the code to be executed.

2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Parameters are values that need to be inside the funtions parentheses in order to execute-which is sometimes called an argument. Parameters that are NOT arguments do not need to be specified and will adopt a default behavior. 

### [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

## Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to [pair-programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/) and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Greater efficiency, this has already helped me in this way with TA guidance. I have been exposed to multiple different ways to do the same lines of code and the differences between them. This will/has aided me on my journey by showing me the simple solution isn't always the best one.

Social skills will help me on my coding journey in seeking and asking for assistance rather than struggle-bussing it out and beating my head against the wall. In some careers you can lone wolf it and fake it til you make it but not in coding. Unless of course you're the one that came up with it- even then I guarantee they had so much more help than we realize.

## Things I want to learn more about
Absolute and Fixed positioning in CSS. I always thought this was part of the C# code or the actual GUI creation rather than CSS.
