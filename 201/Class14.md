Create a 2d or 3d property that you can rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.

# Psychological Safety- reading part deux
[Google Learned from...](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)
1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
Conversational turn-taking, average social sensitivity and a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

The only professional settings I can think of where this happens is in higher education courses- wether it be a college course, a trade school course or this bootcamp at Code Fellows. I personally have not experienced this type of thinking at any of my past experiences in my career turning wrenches. Makes sense why I am now here and left that career behind all the more.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? A higher level of valuable contributions, easier work flow and generally more productive people utilizing each others strengths.
