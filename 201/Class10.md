# Reading Notes for Debugging 

## JS Troubleshooting
- [What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

 Syntax errors are spelling errors that cause your code to not run or crash and provides error messaging

 Logic errors is when the syntax is correct but the code is not what you intended it to be

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Syntax Errors out the wahZOO! Usually have a TA help me or scour the code via a console log and see the error line.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
  I feel like it is something I already getting more and more aware of and this topic influences my long term goals of wanting to be able to develop clean code.

## JS Debugger
- [JS Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
It is a watchdog that guides you by showing you breakpoints where you want to pause code execution

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

Breakpoints will stop JS from executing and let you examine the JS values

3. What is the call stack?

Shows you what code was executed to get to the current line
