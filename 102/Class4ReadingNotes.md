## Helpful Concepts

External
Inline
Internal (sort of like pemdas)

Obviously get rid of the // comment lines but this is the generic start:

//<//!DOCTYPE html>
<//html lang="en-US">
  <//head>
    <//meta charset="utf-8" />
    <//meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <//title>My test page</title>
  <//head>
  <//body>
    <//img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" />
  <//body>
<//html>

## Things to learn more aboot

Inline and Internal im sure have their place and I would like to experiment more with them just to understand the WHY of it. Mainly because it sounds terrifying and I like external/am used to it.
