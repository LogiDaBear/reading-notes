### Hello, My name is Logan Reese, friends and family refer to me as Logi Bear :bear:

This is an entire collection of the reading-notes I have written for CodeFellows. Something to keep in mind while reading is growth mindset.

Explaining growth mindset in my own words and to provide myself and maybe you as well, with a few reminders I would state the following...

Growth mindset to me is maintaining a state of conciousness that isn't always the first thought. Stepping back and analyzing things further helps to root yourself in the positive aspects of criticism when it comes to work, school, and life. This is especially helpful when that "instant gratification monkey" wants to go into potato mode.

- Reminder 1: Its okay to not understand something immediately but not okay to remain in a frustrated state of being.

- Reminder 2: Ask myself the questions of [criticism](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) to navigate myself to a better tomorrow.

- Reminder 3: No pain, no gain! Applies to more than just muscle growth...
